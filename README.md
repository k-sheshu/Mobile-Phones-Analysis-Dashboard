# Mobile Phones Data Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing mobile phone data using Power BI. After preparing a clean dataset through data cleaning processes in Python, the cleaned data was imported into Power BI to create a storytelling and interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into the mobile phone market, making it a powerful tool for decision-making and analysis.

## Workflow in Power BI

### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
- **Objective**: Utilize a cleaned dataset containing key attributes such as Brand, Version, Color, Sales Price, Actual Price, ROM, RAM, Ratings, Reviews, and Screen Size.
- **Steps**:
  - The cleaned dataset (in CSV format) was imported into Power BI.
  - Data types and relationships were verified for proper integration into the Power BI model.

### 2. **Data Modeling**
- **Objective**: Create a structured data model to enable efficient analysis.
- **Process**:
  - Defined relationships between key columns for seamless interaction within the dashboard.
  - Optimized the data model by creating measures and calculated columns for additional insights, such as:
    - Price variance (Actual Price vs. Sales Price).
    - Average Ratings per Brand.
    - Total Reviews by Version or Color.

### 3. **Dashboard Creation**
- **Objective**: Build a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for storytelling and data exploration.
- **Features**:
  - **Visual Elements**:
    - Bar Charts: To compare brands, versions, and price ranges.
    - Pie Charts: For the distribution of colors and storage capacities.
    - Line Charts: To analyze trends in pricing or ratings over time.
    - Heatmaps: To identify correlations between price, ratings, and other attributes.
    - Card Visuals: For key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, average price, and total reviews.
  - **Interactive Features**:
    - Slicers and Filters: Allow users to drill down by brand, version, or price range.
    - Hover Effects: Display additional details on specific data points.
    - Page Navigation: Organized multiple pages for in-depth analysis.
- **Storytelling Approach**:
  - Highlighted popular brands and their performance.
  - Identified trends in pricing and customer preferences based on ratings and reviews.
  - Presented insights on how storage capacity and display size impact price.

### 4. **Insights Delivered**
- Comprehensive analysis of mobile phone sales, including price ranges, popularity, and customer satisfaction.
- Identification of key trends, such as the relationship between price and user ratings or preferences for certain brands and versions.

### 5. **Key Benefits**
- **Business Impact**: Provides actionable insights for marketers, sellers, and buyers in the e-commerce domain.
- **User Engagement**: The interactive dashboard enables users to explore data intuitively, enhancing understanding and decision-making.

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard demonstrates the power of data visualization and storytelling in uncovering insights from structured datasets. It transforms raw data into a visually compelling and informative experience, suitable for various stakeholders.
